# Tech Stack

This project utilizes a modern and efficient tech stack for full-stack web development. Here's an overview of the key technologies and tools used:

## Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js
- **SQLite**: Lightweight, serverless database for data storage
- **OpenAI/Anthropic APIs**: Integration for AI capabilities

## Frontend
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling for fast development and building
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

## Development Environment
- **ESModule**: Using ES6 module syntax for better code organization
- **JSDoc + TypeScript checking**: Leveraging JSDoc comments with TypeScript checking for improved code quality and developer experience
- **Hot Reload**: Implemented for faster development iterations
- **Random Backend Port**: Enhancing security and avoiding port conflicts

## Code Style and Practices
- Plain JavaScript with ES6 syntax
- Custom utility functions preferred over external packages for trivial operations
- Environment variables managed through `process.env` with validation
- Fetch API used for HTTP requests (no axios)

## Version Control and Deployment
- Git for version control
- `.gitignore` configured to exclude common development artifacts and sensitive files

## Documentation
- README.md maintained for project overview and setup instructions

This tech stack is designed to provide a robust, scalable, and developer-friendly environment for building modern web applications.
